### Attention Windows 8.1 and  Windows Server 2012 R2 Users

You must have Windows RT 8.1, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2 update: April 2014 installed in order to install Visual Studio 2015
You can download KB2919355 here https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2919355

### Customizations
You can customize the installation either by specifying your own installation configuration file.
#### Adding optional features
Optional features (Sql tools, phone tools, etc.) are available but not installed by default.
To specify the features you want installed you can download the AdminDeployment.xml and modify it to support your needs.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KennethB/Chocolatey-Packages/master/VisualStudio2015Enterprise/Tools/AdminDeployment.xml
Specifying the optional features above modifies the configuration file used during installation (AdminDeployment.xml). If that is not enough you can provide this file on your own.
Example:
choco install VisualStudio2015Enterprise -packageParameters "--AdminFile c:\path to your\AdminDeployment.xml"
choco install VisualStudio2015Enterprise -packageParameters "--AdminFile http://path/to/your/AdminDeployment.xml"
